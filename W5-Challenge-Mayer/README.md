# Finish the Weather Dashboard

## Introduction:

Herewith my submission for Week-5's challenge: an interactive weather app. The solution is a team effort, developed by Wizards of the Apocalypse.  

The solution comprises: a HTML index page (index.html), a CSS style sheet (style.css), and a Java Script (JS) file (script.js).

The HTML page is sparce, acting only as the entry point for the solution. Bootstrap styling is employed directly (in line), within the HTML, per Bootstrap best practices. The CSS style sheet offers sufficient additional styling. The JS file defines the functionality of the solution.

Specific solution features are not listed within this document. However, some justification of my solution strategy and JS coding will be offered.
The solution has been pushed to my GitHub repository and published to GitHub Pages, for public access and review.

## The Solution

### Behind the Weather Dashboard:

The main functionality of the interactive weather dashboard is defined within the JS file. The JS file contains the client-side logic, accommodating manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM), and event handling. The JS file also manages API consumption and remote data access.  

The JS file was judiciously commented, during development. However, during team collaboration exercises, most of the comments were removed. The HTML and CSS files still contain useful comments.  

### Collaboration:

The project offered a very valuable exercise in collaborative development. Wizards of the Apocalypse spent relatively little time in development. Most contact time was spent practicing with GitHub.
