<!--d-flex: makes the body element a flex container. This enables Flexbox layout for its direct child elements, allowing us to easily align and distribute them.
align-items-center: used in conjunction with d-flex, vertically centers the content within the body. It aligns the flex items along the cross-axis (which is vertical by default for a row-based flex container).
justify-content-center: used with d-flex, horizontally centers the content within the body. It aligns the flex items along the main-axis (horizontal by default for a row-based flex container).
min-vh-100: sets the minimum height of the body to 100% of the viewport height. This ensures that your content is always centered within the visible browser window, even if the content itself isn't tall enough to fill the screen.
bg-light: Bootstrap utility class that applies a light background color to the body element. Bootstrap defines a set of theme colors, and light is typically a soft grey or off-white.-->

        -  Some default padding.
        -  Rounded corners.
        It's designed to hold various types of content (text, images, lists, buttons, etc.) in a structured way.
    shadow-lg: a Bootstrap utility class that applies a large shadow to the element. Bootstrap provides several shadow sizes (shadow-sm, shadow, shadow-lg) to give elements a sense of depth and separation from the background. shadow-lg creates a more pronounced, noticeable shadow.
    p-4: This is a Bootstrap spacing utility class for padding. It applies padding to all four sides, equivalent 16px).
